#### IDEAS
- the key to solve this sort of problems is to use finite state machine. 
- Finite State Machine is composed of four component:
  1. Current State.
  2. Event. Event may trigger the transformation from current state to another state. In this case, the input of a character is an event.
  3. Behavior. When an event happens in a certain state, how do the state machine behave? In TCP, state machine may send an empty bag.
  4. Next State. 
- We could use 2-dim array to denote different states and state transfer. The first dim denotes states and the second state denotes different kind of behavior, the corresponding values represent next state.
