### Thoughts
1. My first idea is to store the tree elements in a array. But in this way the space complexity exceeds O(h). And it will consume a must larger space when the tree is huge. The average time complexity for next() is O(1), while is pretty wired since there's nothing smaller than O(1), which suggests in most cases, I solve it in  O(1), and in some cases, I need to solve it in O(n) or O(h).
2. To find the first element, I need to get the leftmost node. It is much harder to trace back, since ListNode doesn't have a father pointer. I need to store its fathers. The ideal data structure is stack.
3. To find the preceding node, I need to find the smallest element in current node's right tree, which is left-most Treenode. In this step, I did similar things in step 2.
