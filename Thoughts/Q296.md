# 296 Best Meeting Point

## Description

 A group of two or more people wants to meet and minimize the total travel distance.
 You are given a 2D grid of values 0 or 1, where each 1 marks the home of someone in the group.
 The distance is calculated using Manhattan Distance, where distance(p1, p2) = |p2.x - p1.x| + |p2.y - p1.y|.

 For example, given three people living at (0,0), (0,4), and (2,2):

 1 - 0 - 0 - 0 - 1
 |   |   |   |   |
 0 - 0 - 0 - 0 - 0
 |   |   |   |   |
 0 - 0 - 1 - 0 - 0

 The point (0,2) is an ideal meeting point, as the total travel distance of 2+2+2=6 is minimal. So return 6.

 Hint:
 Try to solve it in one dimension first. How can this solution apply to the two dimension case?

## Solution

### Thinking Process

1. Brute Force
 Iterate all the possible positions, and calculate total travel distance.
2. Use symmetric property
 The point that minimize the total travel distance must be in the center of all points in 1 dimension.
3. Expand to 2 dimension
 Find the middle column that minimize the x axis distance. Find the middle row that minimize the y axis. Then calculate the minimal travel distance.
4. If sorting, the time complexity will be O(mn * log mn); If collect the home positions with regular order, the time complexity will be O(mn).

### Implement Process

1. Sort the points with respect to x cordinate and y cordinate accordingly.  
2. Find the middle points, and calculate the total distance.
