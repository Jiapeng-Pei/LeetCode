### Thoughts
1. use dp to solve this problem.
2. dp[i] represent whether the substring[0, i) could be constructed as a sentense. If it's false, then everything is fine. Otherwise we need to store the possible conbinations of words that consist this sentense. How to store them?
3. We need to store the combinations.
