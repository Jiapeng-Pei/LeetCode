## Ideas
1. My initial idea is to use Java stdl like trim or sth to solve this problem. It does work, but I'm pretty sure my interviewer won't like that.
2. I'm going to introduce the second idea. Following is the solution: find a word - reverse it - continue until the end of the string - get rid of duplicate empty characters encountered - reverse the whole string. I need to memorize it.
3. store the new string in the initial string. This idea is used quite often, like some array manipulation.
