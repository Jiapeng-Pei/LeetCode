### Remove Duplicate Letters
Given a string s, remove duplicate letters so that every letter appears once and only once. You must make sure your result is **the smallest in lexicographical order** among all possible results.

#### Example 1:
Input: s = "bcabc"
Output: "abc"

#### Example 2:
Input: s = "cbacdcbc"
Output: "acdb"
 

#### Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 104
s consists of lowercase English letters.

### Thoughts
I could use a special non-decreasing stack to solve this problem. First, calculate the occurance time of all the letters in the string. Second, traverse the string and maintain the non-decreasing  stack. A letter which occurs later in the string could be popped out of the stack. Otherwise if there aren't any duplicates in the remaining string, I have to keep it. In this way I could solve this problem.
