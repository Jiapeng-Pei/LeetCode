## Edit Distance
Given two strings word1 and word2, return the minimum number of operations required to convert word1 to word2.

You have the following three operations permitted on a word:

- Insert a character
- Delete a character
- Replace a character

## Thoughts
1. we define state[i][j] to be the minimum number of operations to convert word1[0, i) to word2[0, j)

2. For the base case to convert word1[0, i) to an emtpy string, we need i time of deletions. so state[0][i] = i && state[0][j] = j.

3. For the general case to convert word1[0, i) to word2[0, j), we will break the problem into sub problems. Suppose word1[i] == word2[j], then no operation is needed and state[i][j] == state[i-1][j-1].
else, we need to think about these 3 ways to convert word1[0, i) to word2[0, j)
  - Insert a character. `state[i][j] = 1 + state[i][j-1]`
  - Delete a character. `state[i][j] = 1 + state[i-1][j]`
  - Replace a character. `state[i][j] = 1 + state[i-1][j-1]`
